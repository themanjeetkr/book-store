        <h2 id="harrystory">Harry Potter</h2>
        <p>
            In 1993, shortly after the end of his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the
            second film, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spends another dissatisfying summer at the Dursleys' house
            studying magic at night without being caught, while family vacations to Egypt and France respectively are
            being spent by his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), both of whom he is
            determined to join in visits to village of Hogsmeade if he has either his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) or Uncle
            Vernon (Richard Griffiths) sign his Hogsmeade permission form. On his thirteenth birthday (July 31), he gets
            the opportunity to do so, as long as he hides his abilities while Vernon's sister Marge arrives for a visit.
            However, at dinnertime, Marge viciously insults Harry and his parents, calling James Potter "a drunk" and
            Lily Potter "a bitch", which in turn triggers Harry's anger and his unconscious magical powers cause her to
            inflate and float away. A livid Vernon orders Harry to put her right, but Harry says that she deserved it.
            Vernon then lunges at him, but Harry retaliates by pointing his wand at him. Vernon exclaims that Harry
            would not be allowed back at Hogwarts for using magic outside of school. Harry flees, expecting to have been
            expelled for using magic outside of school anyway.


        <p>
            After seeing a shaggy black dog, the Knight Bus appears and takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron. There,
            Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) tells Harry he will not be expelled. Harry learns that
            Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is said to be a supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped from Azkaban. The
            next day, Harry comes out of his room and finds a cat chasing a rat. Harry enters the pub and is reunited
            with his best friends Ron and Hermione (the rat being Ron's pet rat, Scabbers and the cat is Hermione's new
            pet cat, Crookshanks). He is also informed by Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) that Black will likely come
            after him and warns Harry not to go after him no matter what. Harry is confused as to why he would look for
            someone who is apparently looking to kill him.</p>
        <div id="harry"> <img src="images/prision2.jpg" alt=""></div>

        Harry and his friends journey to school on the Hogwarts Express, where they share a compartment with their
        new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), who is asleep when they enter.
        Abruptly, the Hogwarts Express is stopped halfway to Hogwarts to let aboard Dementor sent by the Ministry,
        in search of Black. The creature has a profound effect on Harry and causes him to faint, forcing Lupin to
        awaken and repel it with a Patronus Charm. At school, famed Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael
        Gambon) informs the Hogwarts students that because Black has escaped, Dementors have been set up around the
        school as a protection. The trio begin also a new class, Divination, taught by Sybill Trelawney. When they
        read their tea leaves, Trelawney tells Harry that he has the Grim.
        <p>
            In addition to Lupin's appointment,
            Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. As lessons begin, Hermione frequently
            arrives at their various classes, seemingly appearing out of nowhere. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable, as he
            teaches useful spells and helps less confident students like Neville Longbottom. However Hagrid's Care of
            Magical Creatures class does not go as planned, as on the first day, Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the
            Hippogriff Buckbeak into attacking him. His father, Lucius Malfoy successfully has Buckbeak sentenced to
            death. Later, third year students are allowed to go to Hogsmeade, but since Harry's uncle, Vernon, did not
            sign his letter of permission, he cannot go. He instead stays behind, talking with Lupin on the Wooden
            Bridge, who says that he knew Harry's parents and that they were two great individuals.
